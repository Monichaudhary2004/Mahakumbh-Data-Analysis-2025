# Mahakumbh-Data-Analysis-2025
"Analyzed MahaKumbh data using Python, ML models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost), and Power BI dashboards. Predicted crowd levels, event trends, and visitor behaviors for smarter event management and real-time visualization support."

🚩 MahaKumbh Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview
The MahaKumbh Data Analysis Project focuses on the prediction and visualization of crowd patterns during one of the world's largest religious gatherings — the MahaKumbh.
Using machine learning algorithms and business intelligence tools, the project provides actionable insights for crowd management, emergency forecasting, event planning, and resource optimization.

🎯 Objectives
Predict crowd density levels (Low, Medium, High) using machine learning models.

Analyze event-wise, spot-wise, and day-wise visitor trends.

Study the correlation between social media sentiment and visitor turnout.

Create real-time dashboards for visualization using Power BI.
